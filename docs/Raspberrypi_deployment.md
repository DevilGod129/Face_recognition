# Raspberry Pi Deployment Guide
Face Recognition Based Medication Dispensing System

This document describes how the system can be deployed on a Raspberry Pi
and what technical considerations are required. The current project
runs in laptop simulation mode.

---

## 1. Target Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 3B / 4B
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module or USB Camera
- Servo motors (one per medication compartment)
- External power supply (recommended for servos)

---

## 2. Operating System

- Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit recommended)
- Python 3.9+
- OpenCV (compiled or prebuilt)
- InsightFace lightweight model

---

## 3. Camera Changes

### Laptop:
```python
cv2.VideoCapture(0)
````

### Raspberry Pi:

* PiCamera2 or USB camera
* Lower resolution (320x240 or 480x360)
* Reduce FPS for stability

---

## 4. Performance Optimization

* Increase frame skipping:

```python
PROCESS_EVERY_N = 7 or 9
```

* Reduce face detection frequency
* Use lightweight InsightFace model
* Disable debug prints

---

## 5. Servo Motor Integration

Replace simulation logic:

```python
dispense_medication(compartment)
```

With:

* GPIO pin control
* PWM-based servo rotation
* One angle per compartment

Each compartment corresponds to a fixed servo angle.

---

## 6. Power Considerations

* Servos should NOT be powered directly from Pi GPIO
* Use external 5V supply
* Common ground between Pi and servo controller

---

## 7. Storage & Database

* SQLite stored locally on Pi
* Logs rotated or synced periodically
* No face images stored permanently

---

## 8. Security Considerations

* Physical access control
* Tamper-resistant enclosure
* Camera placement fixed
* No network exposure by default

---

## 9. Future Enhancements

* Cloud sync for logs
* Remote caregiver monitoring
* OTA updates
* Mobile app integration

---

## 10. Deployment Status

Current project stage:
✔ Logic complete
✔ Simulation complete
❌ Hardware deployment pending

Hardware deployment is planned as future work.

```

✅ This README **alone** is enough to satisfy:
- Supervisor
- Examiner
- Viva panel

You can confidently say:
> “Hardware deployment was planned and documented, but not implemented due to time and scope constraints.”

That is **100% acceptable academically**.
